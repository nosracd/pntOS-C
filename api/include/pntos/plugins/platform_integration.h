	/**
	 * Takes over secondary control of the daemon from the controller.
	 *
	 * When pntOS first boots, it passes control over to the controller. After the controller has
	 * initialized the plugins it wants to run, it calls this plugin's #take_control to allow for
	 * platform specific control behavior to run. The PlatformIntegrationPlugin (PIP) is not
	 * responsible for calling the PntosCommonPlugin.init_plugin call on any of the plugins passed
	 * in its plugins list, and thus the list of plugins that is passed to the PIP should be pruned
	 * to only those plugins the controller initialized. The PIP is consequently not responsible for
	 * the mediator construction or message routing - those responsibilities fall on the controller.
	 * Instead, the PIP is responsible for doing any additional logic that may be platform specific.
	 * For example, the PIP may decide to output solutions at a particular rate, or to have the
	 * transport plugin passed in its plugins list start/stop listening in response to moding
	 * commands, or inform the orchestration plugin that it should not use a particular sensor at
	 * runtime (via a registry convention).
	 *
	 * In general, the goal of the PIP is to implement the platform-specific needs, whereas the
	 * controller plugin is designed to be the generic portion of the code. The controller should be
	 * designed to be generic and re-useable, but work hand-in-hand with the PIP to fully define the
	 * control behavior of the system.
	 *
	 * Controller responsibilities:
	 * - Defining concurrency model
	 * - Initializing plugins (and constructing/passing in mediator)
	 * - Routing data from transport plugin to orchestration/initialization/inertial plugins
	 * - Routing requests for registry data to registry plugins
	 *
	 * PIP responsibilities:
	 * - Platform specific outputs
	 * - Responding to moding commands from platform
	 * - Routing situational awareness information to other pntOS plugins (via registry convention)
	 *
	 * The parameters to #take_control should be identical to those passed to the controller, with
	 * the exception of the plugins list being a subset of the plugins passed to the controller (and
	 * the number of plugins going down by the number of plugins removed from the list). Which
	 * plugins are passed to the PIP is implementation specific and decided by the controller.
